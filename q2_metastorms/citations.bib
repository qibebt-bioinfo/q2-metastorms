    abstract = "{An accurate and reliable distance (or dissimilarity) among shotgun metagenomes is fundamental to deducing the beta-diversity of microbiomes. To compute the distance at the species level, current methods either ignore the evolutionary relationship among species or fail to account for unclassified organisms that cannot be mapped to definite tip nodes in the phylogenic tree, thus can produce erroneous beta-diversity pattern.To solve these problems, we propose the Dynamic Meta-Storms (DMS) algorithm to enable the comprehensive comparison of metagenomes on the species level with both taxonomy and phylogeny profiles. It compares the identified species of metagenomes with phylogeny, and then dynamically places the unclassified species to the virtual nodes of the phylogeny tree via their higher-level taxonomy information. Its high speed and low memory consumption enable pairwise comparison of 100 000 metagenomes (synthesized from 3688 bacteria) within 6.4 h on a single computing node.An optimized implementation of DMS is available on GitHub (https://github.com/qibebt-bioinfo/dynamic-meta-storms) under a GNU GPL license. It takes the species-level profiles of metagenomes as input, and generates their pairwise distance matrix. The bacterial species-level phylogeny tree and taxonomy information of MetaPhlAn2 have been integrated into this implementation, while customized tree and taxonomy are also supported.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
